# WebDevClub_MCA_JU

Welcome to the **Web Development Club – MCA, Jammu University** 🎉  
This repository is the central hub where club members can **share resources, tutorials, notes, and links** related to web development.

Our twist: 🚀 Instead of uploading files directly, you’ll learn to contribute like a real open-source developer using **GitHub Forks and Pull Requests**.

- `resources.html` → Collection of notes, links, and tutorials (👉 **only modify this file**)
